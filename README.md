MWO-T.A.R.G.E.T.-Config-for-T16000M.--Joystick-left--mouse-right.
=================================================================

This is a TARGET (Thrustmaster config language) config file that has been tested against 
version 1.0.11.340 of the TARGET Script Editor.

You must load the Script Editor and execute this script before starting MWO.  You can stop and restart the script once MWO has started successfully.  Always drop in Testing Grounds before competition.  

Joystick takes over all commands that would be done on keyboard, mouse does weapons and zoom.

Must set joystick handedness setting to LEFT on bottom of joystick.

In-game, remap Joystick X-Axis to Turn Legs

In illustration, two keys separated by a "/" indicates the first key is pulsed on a click. 
The second key is held on a hold of that key longer than 250ms.  

There are two available configuration modes, slide throttle to top to get Mode 1, to bottom to get Mode 2.
